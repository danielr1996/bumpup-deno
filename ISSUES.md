# Issues
Features that are present in bumpup-node but not yet in bumpup-deno

## finding a config file walking up the three
[find-up](https://www.npmjs.com/package/find-up) is currently not supported in deno

## logging not yet implemented
logging is done with console.log, should be replaced with a complete logging solution like winston in node

## Some sanity checks for git are missing

## no test
## no lints
## config file path resolution works only in cwd
## plugins are ignoring options
## rewrite help texts and update doc
