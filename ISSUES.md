# Issues
Features that are present in bumpup-node but not yet in bumpup-deno

## finding a config file walking up the three
[find-up](https://www.npmjs.com/package/find-up) is currently not supported in deno

## logging not yet implemented
logging is done with console.log, should be replaced with a complete logging solution like winston in node
